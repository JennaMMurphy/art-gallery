# Art Gallery Webpage

This is the front end application for an art gallery website.

## Backend

There is no API yet, that is to come.
I was just creating the front-end first :)

Endpoints will be needed for [The contact submission form](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and [fetching the gallery items](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react)
