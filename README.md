# Art Gallery Webpage

This is the front end application for an art gallery website, that contains a contact submission form.

## Backend

There is no API yet, that is to come.
I was just creating the front-end first :)

Endpoints will be needed for [The contact submission form](https://github.com/JennaMMurphy/art-gallery/blob/master/src/components/Page/Contact/Index.tsx) and [fetching the gallery items](https://github.com/JennaMMurphy/art-gallery/blob/master/src/components/Page/Gallery/Index.tsx)
